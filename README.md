Stock Return Prediction (Finance)

Overview

Developed machine learning models to predict next-day stock returns for major technology companies. The project evaluated multiple ML models to assess predictive reliability in financial forecasting.

Dataset
	•	Historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (5 tech companies).
	•	Engineered financial indicators (RSI, moving averages, volatility).

Methodology
	•	Trained models: Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks.
	•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV; feature selection using RFE.
	•	Evaluation with Sharpe Ratio, MSE, and directional accuracy.

Technology Stack

Python · scikit-learn · TensorFlow/Keras · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib

Results
	•	SVM and Linear Regression achieved the best predictive reliability.
	•	Demonstrated ability to combine financial feature engineering and ML for forecasting.
